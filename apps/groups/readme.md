# Groups 2.0

ever wanted to create a group of entities that all have a simular type of name?
for example a group of zwave switches?
and you dont want to add every switch manual?
thats why i created this.

another option i built in is nested view.
nested view is a group in a group.

to use this:
- install Appdaemon (see instructions here http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html )
- add groups.py to your apps directory
- edit apps.yaml like the sample to create your groups.

you dont even have to restart Home assistant to see the result.
every successfull edit from apps.yaml immediatly results in an updated Home assistant GUI.
