# An app to let Alexa talk with Appdaemon

this app is in general there to let people understand the way to create intents in appdaemon.
i created a lot of default functions that can be easy used by replacing some text.
at this moment i only have a german version but i will add an english version as soon as possible

i will also add a tutotial how to add a skill to amazon alexa so you can use it step by step.
if you have questions dont hesitate to ask me on the forum, on discord or here.

i did create a new repository for this app.
