installing this app will give you the option to use an home assistant input boolean to let google assistant listen to you.
the input boolean can be controlled from Alexa, a dashboard or the HA web ui, but it only controls the microphone and speakers connected to the device on which this is installed.

known issues:
 - read overflow warning, the first time the app is used. it only takes up a second.
 - no correct termination when HA is restarted.
 - conflict with other I/O used on the same device.
