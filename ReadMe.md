# My-AppDaemon
My apps, my helpfiles, all about AppDaemon for Home Assistant

## Apps

my apps are still written for appdaemon version 2. There have been some changes in appdaemon 3.
That doesnt effect much from my apps, but 2 things should be changed if you use version 3:
when you read the line:
```
import appdaemon.appapi as appapi
```
replace that with:
```
import appdaemon.plugins.hass.hassapi as hass
```
and when you see:
```
appapi.AppDaemon
```
replace that with:
```
hass.Hass
```
in the near future i will change my apps to version 3
